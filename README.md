# Jsonify

[Jsonify](https://github.com/bsiggelkow/jsonify) Jsonify is to JSON as [Builder](https://github.com/jweirich/builder) is to XML.

## What?

Jsonify provides a ___builder___ style engine for creating correct JSON representations of Ruby objects.

Jsonify hooks into Rails ActionView to allow you to create JSON view templates in much the same way that you can use Builder for XML templates.

## Why?

JSON and XML are without a doubt the most common representations used by RESTful applications. Jsonify was built around the notion that these representations belong in the ___view___ layer of the application.
For XML representations, Rails makes this easy through its support of Builder templates, but, when it comes to JSON, there is no clear approach.

## How?

___coming soon___
